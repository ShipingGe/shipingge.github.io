  I earned my Ph.D. in Software Engineering from the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University in June 2025. 
  I had the privilege of being supervised by Professor <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_blank">Qing Gu (È°æÂ∫Ü)</a> and Assistant Professor <a href="https://zhiweinju.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhiwei Jiang (ËíãÊô∫Â®Å)</a>.
  Prior to my doctoral studies, I completed my B.Sc. in Network Engineering at Nantong University in 2019. 
  Subsequently, I pursued an M.Sc. in Computer Technology at Nanjing University, where I successfully transitioned to the doctoral program in 2021. 
  My research is centered on multimodal video understanding and analysis.
