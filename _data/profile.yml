    I am a final-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at Nanjing University, 
    where I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor <a href="https://isetnju.github.io/guq/index.html" target="_blank">Qing Gu (顾庆)</a> and Assistant Professor <a href="https://zhiweinju.github.io/" target="_blank">Zhiwei Jiang (蒋智威)</a>. 
    I earned my B.Sc. in Network Engineering from Nantong University in 2019, 
    and shortly thereafter, I began my M.Sc. in Computer Technology at Nanjing University. 
    In 2021, I successfully passed the examination to upgrade to the doctoral program, and I am now pursuing a Ph.D. in Software Engineering.
